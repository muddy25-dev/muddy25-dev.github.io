# About Me
**Electrical Engineering Student**

I am currently a Electrical Engineering Student at Virginia Tech. I am working towards a bachlors degree that I hope to complete in May, 2028. I am currently looking for Summer internships locally but willing to move if the opportunities present themselves.
